This folder is purposedly excluded from GIT.

The idea is that you can place your exchange's credentials here and they won't be committed by mistake.
If the values for:

    api.key=
    api.secret=
    api.client_id=

are empty in the main .ini file, then the system will look for a file with the exact same name, in this folder and load
the values from there.
